# scrape-xls-beautifulsoup
Using Beautiful soup to scrape xls doc links, and trying to output those links as a list as Json - Still in Dev

Looked at Agency data on Data.govt.nz and compared to available xls spreadsheets on the Agency home website. Trying to make things easier for the user and Agency by scraping xls spreadsheets from website and making the list available as Json.
Was wanting to be able to scrape, xls, csv and pdf.

Any help would be much appreciated as this is my first go at Python. 

Currently using Education Counts from Ministry of Health NZ as an example as they had a well laid out website that was easyish to manage.
